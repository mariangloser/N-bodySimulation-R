# N-bodySimulation-R
This is a little challenge for me to try coding the n-body simulation in different languages, in this case an obscure choice of the R programming language. R is a statistical language, not a general purpose one, so the challenge was in displaying the simulation. What the program does is to calculate the whole simulation up to a given time t and then display an animation of the whole simulation.

# Requirements
The library pyplot is required to run the code.

# Future
More interactivity might be added in the future with perhaps giving the user the option to create arbitrary points by clicking.
